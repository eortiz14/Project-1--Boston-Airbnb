# Boston Airbnb

Watching and exploring the information inside the 3 datasets of Boston Airbnb service who have information between 2016-09 to 2017-09 there are many question one could ask, looking deeply I define 3 questions using 2 of the 3 datasets. The first dataset named "calendar"  have the records of booking , the second named "listings" have all information about all airbnb that somedody could rent in the city of Boston and the last one named "review" contain the review of people who rented some place in airbnb.
